# tidybnbapp

This is a previous application that I worked on while I was learning Python and Flask.  My wife had the idea to do a BnB
clearning service when we move to New Mexico.  However, we subsequently discovered that the area where we will live will not be
condusive to that sort of business.  This partially complete applciation is the result.  While, not complete, it should give you some
indication of my progress with Python and Flask with SQL Alchemy and Mysql.
